                        <p>I am about to return to Astellas Pharma US, a company I interned for during Summer 2022, as a full-time senior analyst on the Global Brand and Market Analytics teams. During my internship, I directed and completed an exploratory Network Analysis to identify the most influential Hospital Medicine Groups (HMGs) throughout gastric cancer patientâ€™s journey using Python, R and Gephi. My project helped inform key market decisions to prepare for product launch in the US market.</p>
